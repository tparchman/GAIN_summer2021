# Introductory Data Science Tools: Unix and Python



## GAIN program Summer 2021    
**Prof**: Dr. Thomas Parchman; SFB 209; tparchman@unr.edu   
**Co instructor**: Trevor Faske; tfaske@nevada.unr.edu \
**Workshop hours**: 9:00-12:00 AM, August 9 - 11


## Workshop Description
Modern biology, and other fields of science, are increasingly shaped by data sets that are orders of magnitude larger than life scientists have traditionally been trained to work with. For example, major recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have created the ability to affordably generate data spanning billions of DNA sequences in an extremely short period of time. Similar leaps in data acquisition technology are transforming other scientific disciplines as well, including but not limited to: . Spreadsheet software and graphical user interface statistical analysis packages (e.g., Excel, Statistica, JMP) are useless for this scale of data. The ability to maninpulate, process, and analyze large data sets with basic programming and data science tools should accelerate the research productivity and success of graduate students in this era. 

This short workshop will introduce students to basic computational tools (focusing on Unix and Python) to support data science proficiency. This will involve hands on approaches and the analysis of data collected for graduate student research projects as well as examples from genomic data sets generated in my lab. The goal of the workshop is to provide an early starting point for students to gain further expertise in simple programming and efficient manipulation and analysis of large-scale data sets. The tools we will introduce during this workshop are not unique to genomics, and will be of value to research in any scientific field. The continued development of proficiency with these and similar skillsets are guaranteed to improve the efficacy and quality pf graduate research across nearly any field of science.


## Student Learning Outcomes
By the end of the workshop, students should have learned enough to feel enabled and motivated to learn more Unix and Python. The workshop will serve to introduce students to programming, to prepare them for more in depth courses, and most importantly to provide a foundation for ongoing independent learning. 

Specific Student Learning Outcomes:

* Students will be able to operate in a Unix computing environment, and will understand the basic use of Unix computing clusters for research.
     
* Students will be able to write basic programs in Python in order to efficiently manipulate and work with large scale data.

* Students will have enough exposure to freely available resources for Unix and Python to continue independently learning programming skills.

* Students will be able to use basic Unix and Python skills to manipulate large data sets, and to conduct basic analyses of genome level DNA sequencing data.

## Required Materials

* **Computer with Unix operating system** Students with
  Mac computers already have machines running Unix and
  are ready to go. Students without Mac computers will have the option of checking out a Mac laptop for the semester, or will need to figure out how to install Linux or a Linux emulator on their computer. 

* **Supplemental primers, readings and assignments** are provided on the [workshop github page](https://github.com/tparchman/GAIN_summer2021).

### Suggested for more in depth learning
* **Practical computing for biologists** Haddock, S.H.D. and Dunn, C.W., 2011. Sunderland, MA, USA: Sinauer Associates. The book is very useful for both Unix and Python.

## Workshop Format
We will meet from 9:00-12:00 each weekday morning from August 6th to August 12th. At the beginning of each session, we will introduce new concepts and material that will form the basis of the exercises, assignments, or projects we will work through that session. We will cover questions regarding current or previous material, and then students will spend at least half of each class working on writing code independently or in small groups. Students will get the most out of each session if they review the primers and outlines of concepts ahead of time. 


*MAYBE* As the class will be remote this session, we will hold our meetings over zoom. I will send a link to all participants each morning prior to starting.

## Workshop Material Organization

The material for each day of the workshop will be organized in separate directories on [workshop github page](https://github.com/tparchman/GAIN_summer2021). Each of these directories will contain an outline of topics we will cover, the slides that we will use to introduce material, a primer covering example Unix and Python code, and a worksheet of programming exercises. There are also general directories on the repository with supplementary resources for Unix and Python, including cheat sheets, tutorials, and recommended resources for learning more.
